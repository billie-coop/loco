# Ensemble Thinking: Multiple Perspectives by Design

## The Manual Process You've Been Doing

"I have asked various versions of you with different prompts, with varying levels of skepticism to review something."

This is exactly what Loco should do automatically!

## Real Example: "Add authentication to my app"

### Traditional Approach:
One model gives one solution.

### Loco Ensemble Approach:

**Diverge Phase (Parallel S/M models):**

```yaml
Security-First (M):
  "Use OAuth2 with refresh tokens, implement CSRF protection,
   add rate limiting, use bcrypt with high cost factor"

Quick-Ship (S):
  "Start with basic JWT, add complexity later.
   Use Auth0 or Clerk to avoid building from scratch"

User-Experience (S):
  "Magic links are friendlier than passwords.
   Social login reduces friction"

Skeptic (S):
  "What about session hijacking? MITM attacks?
   How do we handle password resets securely?"

Scale-Conscious (M):
  "Design for horizontal scaling from day 1.
   Stateless tokens, Redis for sessions"
```

**Converge Phase (L model synthesizes):**

```markdown
Looking at all perspectives, here's the optimal approach:

1. **Start Simple** (from Quick-Ship): Use NextAuth.js or similar
2. **But Secure** (from Security-First): Enable MFA from day 1  
3. **User-Friendly** (from UX): Offer both email/password and social
4. **Address Concerns** (from Skeptic): Rate limit all endpoints
5. **Future-Proof** (from Scale): Use JWTs for stateless auth

The Skeptic raised good points about session security - let's add
refresh token rotation. The UX perspective on magic links is valid
but maybe as a phase 2 feature.

Here's the implementation plan that balances all concerns...
```

## Prompt Personalities for Models

```go
type Personality struct {
    Name        string
    Prompt      string
    ModelSize   ModelSize
    Attributes  []string
}

var personalities = []Personality{
    {
        Name: "Optimist",
        Prompt: "Find creative ways this could work. Be enthusiastic but realistic.",
        ModelSize: SizeS,
        Attributes: []string{"creative", "positive", "solution-focused"},
    },
    {
        Name: "Skeptic", 
        Prompt: "Identify potential problems, edge cases, and what could go wrong.",
        ModelSize: SizeS,
        Attributes: []string{"critical", "thorough", "risk-aware"},
    },
    {
        Name: "Minimalist",
        Prompt: "Find the simplest solution that could possibly work.",
        ModelSize: SizeS,
        Attributes: []string{"simple", "pragmatic", "YAGNI"},
    },
    {
        Name: "Academic",
        Prompt: "Consider best practices, design patterns, and theoretical optimums.",
        ModelSize: SizeM,
        Attributes: []string{"thorough", "principled", "correct"},
    },
    {
        Name: "Hacker",
        Prompt: "Find quick, clever solutions. Prototype fast, polish later.",
        ModelSize: SizeS,
        Attributes: []string{"fast", "pragmatic", "iterative"},
    },
}
```

## Dynamic Ensemble Selection

Not every request needs every perspective:

```go
func selectEnsemble(request string, userState UserState) []Personality {
    ensemble := []Personality{}
    
    // Always include a skeptic for important changes
    if isHighRisk(request) {
        ensemble = append(ensemble, getPersonality("Skeptic"))
    }
    
    // Add optimist if user is frustrated
    if userState.Frustration > 0.6 {
        ensemble = append(ensemble, getPersonality("Optimist"))
    }
    
    // Add minimalist for complex requests
    if estimatedComplexity(request) > 0.7 {
        ensemble = append(ensemble, getPersonality("Minimalist"))
    }
    
    // For architecture decisions, get more perspectives
    if isArchitectureDecision(request) {
        ensemble = append(ensemble, 
            getPersonality("Academic"),
            getPersonality("Hacker"),
            getPersonality("Scale-Conscious"),
        )
    }
    
    return ensemble
}
```

## Synthesis Strategies

The converger model needs guidance on HOW to synthesize:

### 1. Best-of-Breed
"Take the best idea from each perspective"

### 2. Common-Ground  
"Find what all perspectives agree on"

### 3. Progressive
"Start with simplest, evolve toward complex"

### 4. Risk-Balanced
"Minimize downsides while capturing upsides"

## Example: Your Frustration Scenario

When you mentioned being frustrated with me:

**Ensemble Response:**

```yaml
Empathetic (S):
  "User is frustrated but constructive. Acknowledge and move forward."

Self-Critic (S):
  "We might be over-explaining or missing their actual needs."

Problem-Solver (M):
  "Focus on the cool idea they're excited about now."

Synthesized (L):
  "Acknowledge briefly, then dive into their exciting idea with
   genuine enthusiasm. Show we can adapt and improve."
```

## Cost Optimization

This seems expensive but it's actually efficient:

```
Traditional: 1 XL model thinking for 30 seconds
Cost: $$$

Ensemble: 5 S models (parallel) + 1 L synthesizer  
Time: 5 seconds (parallel) + 5 seconds (synthesis)
Cost: $ (5 small) + $$ (1 large) = $$
Result: Better quality through multiple perspectives
```

## Advanced: Learning Which Ensembles Work

```go
type EnsembleResult struct {
    Request      string
    Personalities []string
    UserRating   int
    TimeToSolve  time.Duration
}

// Over time, learn which combinations work best
func optimizeEnsemble(history []EnsembleResult) {
    // "For debugging, Skeptic + Minimalist works best"
    // "For new features, Optimist + Practical + Academic"
    // "When user is frustrated, always include Empathetic"
}
```

## The Magic: Automatic Perspective Diversity

You've been manually creating perspective diversity by:
1. Asking different versions with different prompts
2. Adding skepticism levels
3. Combining responses

Loco does this automatically by:
1. Running multiple models with different "personalities"
2. Each tuned for a different perspective
3. Synthesizer combines them intelligently

## Real-World Example

Your manual process:
```
You: "Here's my API design"
Claude-1 (normal): "Looks good, here are some improvements..."
Claude-2 (skeptical): "What about rate limiting? Error handling?"
Claude-3 (synthesis): "Combining the feedback..."
```

Loco's automatic process:
```
You: "Here's my API design"
[Behind the scenes: 5 models analyze in parallel]
Loco: "I had my team review this from multiple angles:
       - Security found 2 concerns (auth tokens, CORS)
       - Performance suggests caching on 3 endpoints  
       - UX perspective: error messages need work
       Here's a unified improvement plan..."
```

## This Is Revolutionary Because:

1. **No more blind spots** - Multiple perspectives catch more issues
2. **Faster than sequential** - Parallel analysis
3. **Better than one genius** - Wisdom of crowds
4. **Adapts to need** - Different ensembles for different problems
5. **Learns what works** - Improves ensemble selection over time

You've discovered something profound: manually orchestrating multiple AI perspectives gives better results. Loco just makes this automatic, fast, and intelligent!
