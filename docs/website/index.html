    <h1>DDAID: Shared AI Context</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">thoughts on persistent human-AI collaboration</div>

    <p>I've been thinking about a problem that's been bugging me.</p>
    
    <p>Every time I switch projects or come back to something after a break, I have to re-explain everything to my AI assistant. All that context we built up together just... vanishes. It's like having a conversation with someone who forgets everything overnight.</p>
    
    <p>So I started working on this idea: what if documentation wasn't really for humans to read? What if it was actually a shared memory system between us and our AI collaborators?</p>

    <h2>The Problem I'm Trying to Solve</h2>
    
    <p>When I'm coding with AI assistance, I run into the same issues over and over:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>I explain my project's architecture to ChatGPT. Next session? Gone.</li>
        <li>I tell Claude about our auth system. Tomorrow? It has no idea.</li>
        <li>I switch between projects and lose all that built-up understanding.</li>
        <li>Different AI tools suggest conflicting patterns because they don't share context.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The standard answer is "write better documentation," but let's be honest - documentation is usually out of date the moment it's written. And more importantly, it's not really solving the AI context problem.</p>

    <h2>The Idea: DDAID</h2>
    
    <p>Documentation-Driven AI Development (DDAID) is about creating persistent shared context that both humans and AI can use. Not documentation in the traditional sense, but a living memory system.</p>
    
    <p>Here's how I'm thinking about it:</p>
    
    <div class="box">
        <p><strong>Instead of:</strong> Write docs → Hope someone reads them → AI doesn't know they exist</p>
        <p><strong>What if:</strong> Code changes → Context updates automatically → AI remembers next time</p>
    </div>

    <h2>How It Works (Or How I Think It Should)</h2>
    
    <p>The basic pieces:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Git-aware context detection</strong> - Only update what actually changed</li>
        <li><strong>Specialized agents</strong> - Different bots for architecture, APIs, security, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Model-agnostic format</strong> - Works with any AI, not locked to one provider</li>
        <li><strong>Lives with your code</strong> - Context travels in your repo</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The key insight is that this isn't about generating documentation for humans. It's about maintaining a shared understanding that persists across sessions, models, and time.</p>

    <h2>What I'm Building</h2>
    
    <p>I'm working on a tool called Loco that explores these ideas. It's still early, but the goal is to make human-AI collaboration more continuous - less starting from scratch, more building on what came before.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        Imagine if your AI assistant remembered your project as well as you do. That's what I'm trying to build.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Why This Matters (To Me)</h2>
    
    <p>I switch between projects a lot. I forget things. I come back to code I wrote months ago and wonder what I was thinking. Having a system that maintains context - not just for me, but for my AI collaborators - feels like it could change how we build software.</p>
    
    <p>Maybe it's not revolutionary. Maybe it's just a useful idea. But I think it's worth exploring.</p>

    <h2>If You're Interested</h2>
    
    <p>The code is on GitHub. It's a work in progress, but if these ideas resonate with you, I'd love to hear your thoughts or see what you build with it.</p>
