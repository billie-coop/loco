# Table Stakes: Core Requirements for Multi-Model Orchestration

## The Two Fundamentals

### 1. Orchestration Layer
"We need an orchestration layer that's probably going to be a model"

```go
type Orchestrator interface {
    // Parse user input and decide strategy
    PlanWork(input string) WorkPlan
    
    // Route tasks to appropriate models
    AssignTask(task Task) (model Model, strategy Strategy)
    
    // Combine results from multiple models
    Synthesize(results []ModelResult) FinalResponse
}
```

The orchestrator itself should be a model (probably M-sized) that:
- Understands the user's intent
- Knows each model's strengths
- Can break down complex requests
- Routes work intelligently

### 2. Message Parser
"We need really good parsing of messages"

```go
type MessageParser interface {
    // Extract structured data from model outputs
    ParseToolCalls(response string) []ToolCall
    
    // Identify message type and intent
    ClassifyResponse(response string) ResponseType
    
    // Extract actionable items
    ExtractActions(response string) []Action
    
    // Handle partial/streaming responses
    ParsePartial(chunk string) PartialResult
}
```

This is CRITICAL because every model outputs differently:
- Some wrap JSON in markdown blocks
- Some use XML-like tags
- Some just write prose
- Streaming adds complexity

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Orchestration (What we build first)
```
User → Orchestrator → Single Model → Response
              ↓
        (picks which model)
```

### Phase 2: Parallel Execution
```
User → Orchestrator → Multiple Models → Synthesis
              ↓
        (runs in parallel)
```

### Phase 3: Full Pipeline
```
User → Preprocessor → Orchestrator → Ensemble → Synthesis
```

## The Local Advantage

"You're a lot more able to experiment with this stuff when you're running a bunch of models locally"

This is KEY! With local models:
- **No API costs** - Run 50 experiments without thinking about bills
- **No rate limits** - Parallelize as much as your hardware allows  
- **Privacy** - Experiment with sensitive data
- **Latency** - No network overhead
- **Control** - Pick exact models for each role

## Parsing Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Different Output Formats
```yaml
Model A: "I'll use the read_file tool: {"name": "read_file", "path": "main.go"}"
Model B: "<tool>read_file</tool><params>{"path": "main.go"}</params>"
Model C: "To read the file, we need to call read_file with path='main.go'"
```

Solution: Multi-pattern parser
```go
var patterns = []ParsePattern{
    {Regex: `\{"name":\s*"(\w+)".*\}`, Type: JSON},
    {Regex: `<tool>(\w+)</tool>`, Type: XML},
    {Regex: `call (\w+) with`, Type: PROSE},
}
```

### Challenge 2: Streaming Responses
Models output tokens one at a time. Parser needs to handle:
```
Chunk 1: "I'll read"
Chunk 2: " the file using"  
Chunk 3: " <tool>re"
Chunk 4: "ad_file</tool>"
```

Solution: Stateful parser that accumulates and detects boundaries

### Challenge 3: Partial/Malformed JSON
```
Model outputs: {"name": "read_file", "params": {"path": "main.go"
(Missing closing braces)
```

Solution: Fuzzy parsing with recovery

## Minimum Viable Orchestrator

```go
// Start simple!
type MVPOrchestrator struct {
    models map[ModelSize]string
    parser MessageParser
}

func (o *MVPOrchestrator) Route(request string) (string, Model) {
    // Simple rules to start
    switch {
    case strings.Contains(request, "fix"):
        return "debug", o.models[SizeL]
    case strings.Contains(request, "list"):
        return "browse", o.models[SizeXS]
    default:
        return "general", o.models[SizeM]
    }
}
```

## The Vision: Open Patterns

"We can propose them to the greater industry"

YES! Loco could pioneer patterns that become standard:

1. **T-shirt sizing** - More intuitive than parameter counts
2. **Ensemble thinking** - Multiple perspectives by default
3. **Emotional preprocessing** - Adaptive AI behavior
4. **Local-first orchestration** - Privacy + experimentation

## Next Steps

1. **Build core parser** - Handle 80% of model outputs
2. **Simple orchestrator** - Route by keywords initially  
3. **Add ONE ensemble** - Optimist + Skeptic + Synthesizer
4. **Measure & iterate** - Does it actually work better?

## Why This Matters

Current AI CLIs are mostly thin wrappers around APIs. Loco could be the first to show:
- Local models can compete through smart orchestration
- Multiple small models > one large model (sometimes)
- Emotional intelligence makes AI more effective
- These patterns work and should be everywhere

Start simple, prove it works locally, then the patterns can spread everywhere - exactly your vision!
