# Loco Architecture Refactoring Plan: Lessons from Crush

**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: **🚀 MAJOR PROGRESS - Phases 1-3 Complete!**  
**Inspired By**: Analysis of [Crush](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush) - Charm's AI Coding Assistant

## Executive Summary

We analyzed Crush, Charm's official AI coding assistant, to understand how a mature Bubble Tea application handles complex UI state, multiple LLM providers, and tool execution. Crush demonstrates several architectural patterns that would significantly improve Loco's maintainability and extensibility.

This document outlines a phased refactoring approach that will transform Loco from a monolithic chat model into a component-based architecture with proper separation of concerns.

**🎉 UPDATE**: We've completed the core architectural transformation! Phases 1-3 are done, plus bonus features. This document now tracks our progress and the exciting next steps.

## Why Crush's Architecture Works

1. **Component Isolation**: Each UI element is self-contained with its own state and update logic
2. **Event-Driven Communication**: Components don't directly reference each other
3. **Service Layer**: Business logic is separated from UI concerns
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new providers, tools, and UI elements
5. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation

## Current State: Loco's Pain Points

### The Monolithic Model
```go
// internal/chat/chat.go - Our current Model has 30+ fields!
type Model struct {
    // UI Components mixed with business logic
    input            textarea.Model
    viewport         viewport.Model
    spinner          spinner.Model
    
    // Business state
    llmClient        llm.Client
    messages         []llm.Message
    sessionManager   *session.Manager
    
    // Streaming state
    isStreaming      bool
    streamingMsg     string
    streamingTokens  int
    
    // Analysis state
    analysisState    *AnalysisState
    knowledgeManager *knowledge.Manager
    
    // ... and 20+ more fields
}
```

### Problems This Creates

1. **Tight Coupling**: Everything knows about everything else
2. **State Management**: Hard to track what updates what
3. **Testing Difficulty**: Can't test components in isolation
4. **Feature Addition**: Adding features requires touching many parts
5. **Code Navigation**: 1000+ line files are hard to navigate

## Proposed Architecture

### Component-Based Structure
```
internal/
├── app/
│   └── app.go           # Core application orchestrator
├── tui/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── chat/
│   │   │   ├── input.go      # Text input component
│   │   │   ├── messages.go   # Message list/viewport
│   │   │   └── sidebar.go    # Session & model info

    └── coordinator.go        # Service coordination
```

### Key Architectural Patterns

#### 1. Component Interface
```go
type Component interface {
    Init() tea.Cmd
    Update(tea.Msg) (tea.Model, tea.Cmd)
    View() string
}

type Sizeable interface {
    SetSize(width, height int) tea.Cmd
}

type Focusable interface {
    Focus() tea.Cmd
    Blur() tea.Cmd
    Focused() bool
}
```

#### 2. Event System
```go
// Instead of direct method calls:
// ❌ m.sidebar.SetModel(modelName)

// Use events:
// ✅ return pubsub.Publish(ModelSelectedEvent{Model: modelName})
```

#### 3. Service Layer
```go
type App struct {
    // Services handle business logic
    Sessions    *session.Manager
    LLM         llm.Client
    Permissions *PermissionService
    Knowledge   *knowledge.Manager
    
    // UI components just display
    components  map[string]Component
}
```

## Implementation Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Component Separation - **COMPLETED** 🎉

**Goal**: Break the monolithic Model into focused components

1. **✅ Extract Status Bar**
   - ✅ Status message logic in `internal/tui/components/status/status.go`
   - ✅ Timer-based message clearing implemented
   - ✅ Support for different message types (info, warning, error)

2. **✅ Extract Sidebar**
   - ✅ Model info display in `internal/tui/components/chat/sidebar.go`
   - ✅ Session information included
   - ✅ Analysis progress indicators added

3. **✅ Extract Message List**
   - ✅ Message rendering in `internal/tui/components/chat/messages.go`
   - ✅ Streaming message handling implemented
   - ✅ Tool message rendering with syntax highlighting

4. **✅ Extract Input Component**
   - ✅ Input logic in `internal/tui/components/chat/input.go`
   - ✅ Command parsing logic maintained
   - ✅ Multi-line input support

5. **✅ Create Layout Manager**
   - ✅ Layout coordination in `internal/tui/components/core/`
   - ✅ Responsive sizing implemented
   - ✅ Component placement system

**✅ Deliverable**: Loco works with clean, modular components!

### ✅ Phase 2: Event System - **COMPLETED** 🎉

**Goal**: Decouple components with pub/sub

1. **✅ Create Event Broker**
   ```go
   // ✅ internal/tui/events/broker.go
   type Broker struct {
       subscribers map[events.EventType][]chan events.Event
       mutex       sync.RWMutex
   }
   ```

2. **✅ Define Event Types**
   ```go
   // ✅ internal/tui/events/types.go
   type ModelSelectedEvent struct {
       Model string
       Size  llm.ModelSize
   }
   
   type SessionChangedEvent struct {
       SessionID string
       Session   *session.Session
   }
   // ... plus many more event types
   ```

3. **✅ Convert Direct Calls to Events**
   - ✅ Components publish events instead of calling methods
   - ✅ Components subscribe to relevant events
   - ✅ Main model routes events via broker

**✅ Deliverable**: Components communicate cleanly via events!

### ✅ Phase 3: Service Layer - **COMPLETED** 🎉

**Goal**: Extract business logic from UI

1. **✅ Create App Structure**
   ```go
   // ✅ internal/app/app.go
   type App struct {
       // Existing services
       Sessions         *session.Manager
       LLM              llm.Client
       Knowledge        *knowledge.Manager
       Tools            *tools.Registry
       ModelManager     *llm.ModelManager
       
       // New services
       LLMService       *LLMService
       PermissionService *PermissionService
       CommandService   *CommandService
       EventBroker      *events.Broker
   }
   ```

2. **✅ Move Business Logic**
   - ✅ Tool execution approval → PermissionService
   - ✅ LLM streaming coordination → LLMService
   - ✅ Command handling → CommandService
   - ✅ Analysis management in knowledge service

3. **✅ Simplify UI Components**
   - ✅ Components only handle display and user input
   - ✅ Business logic happens in app services
   - ✅ Services communicate via events
   - ✅ Model.go reduced from 935 to 679 lines (27% reduction!)

**✅ Deliverable**: Clean separation between UI and business logic!

### 🔄 Phase 4: Dialog System - **MOSTLY COMPLETED** 

**Goal**: Consistent modal dialog handling

1. **✅ Create Dialog Interface**
   ```go
   // ✅ internal/tui/components/dialog/base.go
   type Dialog interface {
       Component
       OnConfirm() tea.Cmd
       OnCancel() tea.Cmd
   }
   ```

2. **✅ Implement Core Dialogs**
   - ✅ Model selection in `model_select.go`
   - ✅ Team selection in `team_select.go`
   - ✅ Settings/preferences in `settings.go`
   - ✅ Permissions dialog in `permissions.go`
   - ✅ Help dialog in `help.go`
   - ✅ Quit confirmation in `quit.go`
   - ✅ Command palette in `command_palette.go`
   - 🔄 Session switcher (pending)

3. **✅ Add Dialog Manager**
   - ✅ Dialog stacking in `manager.go`
   - ✅ Keyboard navigation with auto-sizing
   - ✅ Escape to close functionality

**🔄 Deliverable**: Mostly done - just need session management dialog!

### 📋 Future Consideration: Provider Abstraction 🔌

**Goal**: Support multiple LLM providers (when needed)

- OpenAI API, Anthropic API, Ollama support
- Provider selection in settings
- API key management
- Model filtering

**Status**: Deferred - Current LM Studio integration works well

## Migration Strategy

### Incremental Refactoring
1. **Branch Strategy**: Create feature branch for each phase
2. **Testing**: Add tests for new components before removing old code
3. **Parallel Development**: Old and new code can coexist temporarily
4. **Feature Flags**: Use build tags to switch between implementations

### Code Example: Before and After

**Before** (Monolithic):
```go
func (m *Model) Update(msg tea.Msg) (tea.Model, tea.Cmd) {
    switch msg := msg.(type) {
    case tea.KeyMsg:
        // 500+ lines handling everything
        if m.showModelSelect {
            // Model selection logic mixed in
        }
        // Input handling
        // Status updates
        // Message updates
        // ... etc
    }
}
```

**After** (Component-based):
```go
func (m *Model) Update(msg tea.Msg) (tea.Model, tea.Cmd) {
    var cmds []tea.Cmd
    
    // Each component handles its own updates
    for id, component := range m.components {
        updated, cmd := component.Update(msg)
        m.components[id] = updated
        cmds = append(cmds, cmd)
    }
    
    // Handle app-level events
    switch msg := msg.(type) {
    case pubsub.Event:
        return m.handleEvent(msg)
    }
    
    return m, tea.Batch(cmds...)
}
```

## Benefits of This Approach

### Immediate Benefits
1. **Easier Debugging**: Components have focused responsibilities
2. **Parallel Development**: Multiple people can work on different components
3. **Better Testing**: Components can be tested in isolation
4. **Cleaner Code**: Smaller, focused files instead of 1000+ line monsters

### Long-term Benefits
1. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features
2. **Maintainability**: Changes are localized
3. **Performance**: Can optimize components independently
4. **Reusability**: Components can be used in other projects
